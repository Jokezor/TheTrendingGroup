# TheTrendingGroup
A program that will take trending data of a company from Google trends and then do analysis and correlations with the data to the company's stock data.


Currently the Main_script.py calls on Google_data.py with input variables `Company` and `Timeframe`. Google_data.py then returns the `Trend` and `Date` data in a hashtable. Main_script.py then prints out this value.


## To do:

1. Replace Dashboard with input that matches what is needed to run Main_script.py.
2. Make Analyze hidden unique to each user.
