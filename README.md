# TheTrendingGroup
A program that will take trending data of a company from Google trends and then do analysis and correlations with the data to the company's stock data.


Currently the Main_script.py calls on Google_data.py with input variables `Company` and `Timeframe`. Google_data.py then returns the `Trend` and `Date` data in a hashtable. Main_script.py then prints out this value.


## To do:

1. Check so everything works.
2. Analysis of trending data.
3. Build Stock_data.py
4. Get return value of Stock_data.py
5. Analysis of all data with correlation with stock.
6. Nice plots of everything.
