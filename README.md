# TheTrendingGroup 
A program that will take trending data of a company from Google trends and then do analysis and correlations with the data to the company's stock data.


Currently the Main_script.py calls on Google_data.py with input variables `Company` and `Timeframe`. Google_data.py prints the results from the google trends data. Trying to get this return value to Main_script.py.


To do:

1. Fix return value from Google_data.py
2. Check so everything works.
3. Analysis of trending data.
3. Build Stock_data.py
4. Get return value of Stock_data.py
5. Analysis of all data with correlation with stock.
6. Nice plots of everything.
